# SSOWithCertificates


Everyone one of us uses different applications provided by ASU. Logging into each application to access any ASU data is cumbersome. SSO is not shared between different applications.

The Project Aims to provide an application which would enable sharing of this SSO authentication among different applications. 

Approach 1:

ASU provides with an Identity for using the ASU encrypted wireless n/w, this can be utilized for authenticating users instead of typing username's and passwords.

Approach 2:

Research of Authentication tokens are used by applications and come up with an approach to share those among different apps.


The Approaches may change at later stages of the project based on the feasibility and time to implement.
